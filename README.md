Programming is a difficult job, and once you start working in this industry, you will face new obstacles and may be asked to tackle problems that no one else has solved or for which there is no solution. You are then required to use your problem-solving and logical abilities to come up with a solution in the shortest amount of time possible. As a result, the single and unambiguous purpose of competitive programming is "to train a programmer so that his or her logical capacity grows and he or she is prepared to produce code for the hard situation."
